# Expected Metrics Configuration for MaaS Observability Tests
# ==========================================================
#
# This file defines the expected metrics that should be available after
# deploying the MaaS observability stack. Tests will FAIL with informative
# messages if:
#   - A metric is missing (not found in the endpoint)
#   - A metric is missing expected labels
#   - A Kubernetes resource (TelemetryPolicy, Telemetry) is not deployed
#
# Update this file when:
#   - Adding new metrics to the observability stack
#   - Changing metric names or labels
#   - Adding new observability components

# Kubernetes resources that must exist for observability
